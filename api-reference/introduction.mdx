The Simplex SDK enables AI-powered browser automation and element detection. It provides a high-level interface for finding elements, automating interactions, and executing complex web tasks.

All endpoints are available as standalone API calls or as part of the Python SDK. You can get started with the SDK by following the [quickstart](/api-reference/using-the-api/sdk-intro).

Example usage for the Python SDK is available in our [cookbook](cookbook/examples).
