## SDK Installation

```bash
pip install simplex-python-sdk
```

## Architecture Overview

The SDK consists of three main components:

1. **Simplex Client** - The main entry point that provides AI-powered element detection and task automation
2. **Browser Actor** - Handles browser automation and recording, included within the Simplex Client
3. **Browser Interactions** - Defines the possible browser actions and elements that can be automated

## Quick Example

```python
from simplex import Simplex

# Initialize the Simplex client (includes BrowserActor)
client = Simplex(api_key="your-api-key")

# Navigate to a page using the browser actor
client.browser_actor.navigate_to_url("https://example.com")

# Take a screenshot
screenshot = client.browser_actor.take_screenshot()

# Use AI to find an element
bbox = client.find_element(
    element_description="Sign up button",
    screenshot=screenshot
)

# Get next step for a task
next_step = client.get_next_step(
    task_description="Sign up for an account",
    screenshot=screenshot
)
```
