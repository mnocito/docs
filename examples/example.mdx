title: 'Full Example: Extract GitHub Contribution Graph'

Here's how to write an automation that extracts an image of a GitHub contribution graph from a GitHub profile.

To start, let's create our search function.

```python search.py
from simplex import Simplex
simplex = Simplex(api_key="your_api_key")

def search(website, search_query):
    simplex.goto(website)
    simplex.click("the search bar")
    simplex.type(search_query)
    simplex.press_enter()

```

We'll then use this search function to navigate to `mitchellh`'s GitHub profile and call the `extract_image` function to get the contribution graph.

```python
github_profile = "mitchellh"
search("https://google.com", f"{github_profile} github")
simplex.click("the first search result link")
# The graph isn't fully visible on page load, so we have to scroll 200px.
simplex.scroll(200)
# Since we use vision language models, sometimes you have to play 
# around with prompting to get the right image.
# In this case, "calendar graph" worked well.
image = simplex.extract_image("calendar graph")
```

### Result

![GitHub Contribution Graph](/images/github-contribution-graph.png)

That's a lot of contributions!
