title: 'Example: Extract GitHub Contribution Graph'
description: 'Get a github contribution graph from a profile'
---

We're looking to write an automation that gets images of a github contribution graph from a github profile.

To start, let's create a function that can search a query on almost any website.

```python search.py
from simplex import Simplex
simplex = Simplex(api_key="api_key")


def search(website, search_query):
    simplex.goto(website)
    simplex.click("the search bar")
    simplex.type(search_query)
    simplex.press_enter()

```

We'll then use this search function to navigate to potential hires' github profiles and call the `extract_image` function to get the contribution graph.

```python
simplex = Simplex(os.getenv("SIMPLEX_API_KEY"))

report = {}
for hire in potential_hires:
    search("https://google.com", f"{hire} github")
    simplex.click("the first search result link")
    simplex.scroll(200)
    # Since we use vision language models, sometimes 
    image = simplex.extract_image("calendar graph")
    report[hire] = image

```
