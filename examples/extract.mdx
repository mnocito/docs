description: 'Get github contribution graphs from potential hires'
---

Everyone knows watering your github graph is important -- greener graphs are good signs when screening potential hires. 
Let's use Simplex to extract the contribution graph from potential hires' github profiles. 

We can use the [search](search.mdx) function to navigate to the github profile and extract the contribution graph.

```python
simplex = Simplex(os.getenv("SIMPLEX_API_KEY"))

report = {}
for hire in potential_hires:
    search("https://google.com", f"{hire} github")
    simplex.click("the first link")
    simplex.scroll(200)
    image = simplex.extract_image("calendar graph") # we found this description works best to capture the whole contribution graph
    report[hire] = image

```
