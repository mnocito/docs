## Requesting an API Key
Since we're an early-stage company, we're asking users to talk to us for 10 minutes before provisioning an API key. You can [book time with us here](https://cal.com/simplex-data/15min) or equivalently click the **Request API Access** button in the top right. We promise we'll be quick!
## SDK Installation
If you don't have playwright installed, you'll need to install it first.
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```
Then, just run 
```bash
pip install simplex
```

## Some quick examples
Automate an entire workflow
```python
# Example workflow
urls = []
assets = ["apple watch", "victorian chair"]

simplex = Simplex(api_key=os.getenv("SIMPLEX_API_KEY"), driver=driver)
simplex.goto("https://www.cgtrader.com/")

for asset in assets:
    simplex.goto("https://www.cgtrader.com")
    simplex.do(f"search for {asset}")  
    simplex.do("click on search button")
    simplex.do(f"click on the first product")
    driver.wait_for_timeout(3000)
    urls.append(simplex.driver.url)
```

or perform lower level actions 
```python
from simplex import Simplex

# Initialize the Simplex client
client = Simplex(api_key="your-api-key")

# Navigate to a page using the browser actor
client.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com/show")

# Find an element on the page
client.find_element("submit")

# or get a trajectory for a small task
actions = client.step_to_action("click on the top post")
```
