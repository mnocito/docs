## Requesting an API Key
Since we're an early-stage company, we're asking users to talk to us before provisioning an API key. You can [fill out a 10 second form here](https://simplex.sh/playground#api-request-form) or equivalently click the **Request API Access** button in the top right. We promise we'll be quick!
## SDK Installation
If you don't have playwright installed, you'll need to install it first.
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```
Then, just run 
```bash
pip install simplex
```
