Simplex's Python SDK is broken down into three functions: `get_next_step`, `is_task_complete`, and `find_element`.

## Example

```python
def autonomous_flight_search():
    client = Simplex(api_key=os.getenv("SIMPLEX_API_KEY"))


    high_level_task = "Find a flight from New York to San Francisco on January 1st, 2025"

    client.browser_actor.navigate_to_url("https://www.google.com/travel/flights")
    state = client.browser_actor.take_screenshot()

    ## can add some max iters here as well
    while not client.is_task_complete(high_level_task, state):
        next_step = client.get_next_step(high_level_task, state)
        ## need to add find_element somewhere
        actions = client.step_to_action(next_step, state)

        for action in actions:
            client.browser_actor.execute(action)
            state = client.browser_actor.take_screenshot()

        
    client.browser_actor.save_recording("output.mp4")
```
