## Sample Usage
In this example, we're building a report for NVIDIA's latest stock trends and have navigated to see NVIDIA's stock trends
on Google.

![NVIDIA stock trends](/images/nvidia-stock.png)

We can extract NVIDIA's stock trends chart to an image to add to our report like this:

```python
from simplex import Simplex
simplex = Simplex(api_key="your_api_key")
simplex.goto("https://www.google.com/search?q=nvidia+stock")
image = simplex.extract_image("stock trends and market summary")
```

The output image will look like this:

![NVIDIA stock trends](/images/nvidia-stock-extracted.png)
