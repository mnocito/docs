## Sample Usage
Let's say we're building a report for NVIDIA's latest stock trends and have navigated to see NVIDIA's stock trends
on google.

![NVIDIA stock trends](/images/nvidia-stock.png)

We can extract their stock trends chart to an image to add to our report like this:

```python
image = client.extract_image("stock trends and market summary")
```

The output image will look like this:

![NVIDIA stock trends](/images/nvidia-stock-extracted.png)
